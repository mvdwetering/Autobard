This addon will try to switch to a tabard that provides rep when entering a dungeon.

Status: 
Seems to work pretty OK
Still lts of debug logging

Known limitations:
When the addond could not switch out the tabard when leaving the dungeon (for example 
because bags were full). Then you have to fix it manually


I made the addon because I forget to switch to a rep tabard when entering a dungeon.
Normally I wear a pretty tabard or none. It picks the tabard for the faction that
has most rep already so you will finish that factions rep first and then finish another one.

So basically all the addon does is try to switch to a tabard that provides rep when in a dungeon.

Note:
This is also a playground to getting to know Git a bit.
